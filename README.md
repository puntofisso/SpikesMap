# SpikesMap
Replicating in Python the electoral maps made by the Berliner Morgenpost.

The Berliner Morgenpost made these absolutely brilliant electoral maps that show, for each major party, the variation of votes in each constituency based on two elections. They released the R code at [https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/analyse-bundestagswahl-2017/data/btw17_analysis.html].

Thing is, I'm terrible at R. So I've created a jupyter notebook with a very simple workflow to create similar maps in Python. The jupyet  guides you through all the steps required.

**UPDATED** Now with a full walk-through with the maps for the [general election 2017-2019](https://github.com/puntofisso/SpikesMap/blob/master/Spikes%20map%20%5Bunprojected%5D%20-%20GE2019.ipynb).
